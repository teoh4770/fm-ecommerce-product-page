## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CUBE CSS Methodology: Composition(Structure), Utility, Block, Exception
- JavaScript

### Useful resources

This project's hardest challenge is to implement the CUBE CSS Method. It took me quite a time to implement it at the beginning. However, it saves me so much time, effort and brain power when I tried to make simple or even complex changes on the code. The setup is long, but the reward is worthwhile.

This is the CUBE CSS resources:

2. [https://cube.fyi/#what-does-cube-css-stand-for](https://cube.fyi/#what-does-cube-css-stand-for)

Second hardest challenge is the responsive font and space in CSS. This time I look into the responsive font article, and see how it is implemented and how clamp is used

This is the responsive font resources:
